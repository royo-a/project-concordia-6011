\section{Testing the ab$^x$}
The author of the function provided all the unit tests which were done using the JUnit library. Since we had a difference in the development environment, at first I was facing some issues with the JUnit library configuration. After resetting the configurations, JUnit worked correctly. \\
At first I individually ran the test cases for various types of input. They all passed. Finally, I ran the test class all together and that passed as well.\\
The IDE I was using was IntelliJ IDEA and I had JUnit 5 installed along with Juniper as dependencies. The OS I am using is MacOS 11.5.
